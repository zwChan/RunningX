# RunningX (RunHelper)

=7th, 2016, but I can't find a 
 appropriate app for the daily training running. At the same time, I am taking a mobile programming
 class, so I decide to develop a running app for the homework also for my daily running.
 
 It is simple and not perfect now, but it works pretty well, and I will improve it at the winter holiday.

## Features
Now it has the following functions:
- Record the trace you run and other basic information, such use total distance, total time, current speed.
- Show you trace on the map, and update the trace dynamically.
- Show the speed of you running;
- Show the altitude of you running trace;
- Support save your running in you storage, and you can review it later;
- Support Google map and Gaode map, you may know, some poor guys can not use google map;
- Support Pace and Speed to measure how fast you run.
- Support two kinds of length units: International(Km) and United States(Mile)
