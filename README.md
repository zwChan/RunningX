# RunningX

I just finished this simple app for my daily running. It is simple and not perfect now, but it works pretty well, and I will improve it at the winter holiday.

## Features
Now it has 4 functions:
- Record the trace you run and other basic information, such use total distance, total time, current speed.
- Show you trace on the map, and update the trace dynamically.
- Show the speed of you running;
- Show the altitude of you running trace.
